 * This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.css, which will include all the files

 * Any CSS and SCSS file within this directory, lib/assets/stylesheets, or any plugin's
 * vendor/assets/stylesheets directory can be referenced here using a relative path.
 *
 * You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at the bottom of the
 * compiled file so the styles you add here take precedence over styles defined in any other CSS/SCSS
 * files in this directory. Styles in this file should be added after the last require_* statement.
 * It is generally better to create a new file per style scope.

// The available variables can be found here.

// Make sure the file has .scss extension (or .sass for Sass syntax). If you have just generated a new Rails app, it may come with a .css file instead. If this file exists, it will be served instead of Sass, so rename it:

// $ mv app/assets/stylesheets/application.css app/assets/stylesheets/application.scss
// Then, remove all the *= require and *= require_tree statements from the Sass file. Instead, use @import to import Sass files.

// Do not use *= require in Sass or your other stylesheets will not be able to access the Bootstrap mixins and variables.

// Bootstrap JavaScript depends on jQuery. If you're using Rails 5.1+, add the jquery-rails gem to your Gemfile:



 @import "bootstrap";
