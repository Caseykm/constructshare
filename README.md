## Problem

There is a unfulfilled need for an online peer to peer construction equipment leasing website. There are many sites of individual, local leasing companies, but none are peer to peer.  

This can leave renters in limbo finding conveniently located equipment because individual leasing companies may not be close, while their neighbour one km away, may have what you need.  
 
Traditional renting also comes with higher rental costs than what peer to peer leasing could provide.  
And if you're a potential or existing equipment owner, you have limited options to make use of idling equipment, which can make ownership uneconomical. 

The construction lending market is expanding significantly increasing the demand for equipment, while an increasing  potential supply of inventory in the form of left-over equipment from completed projects, is promoting a great demand for a peer to peer construction equipment platform.  Globally, there is only one company really providing this and they are only in a handful of local markets mostly in the US.

## Solution

Create a peer to peer, construction leasing/lending website that can meet the ever-increasing demand for equipment and harness the growing supply of left-over equipment, making equipment ownership economical, and sustainable.  
For lessees, this solution will untap latent inventory,  enabling increased return on assets.  For lessors, it will provide increased equipment choice, locational convenience and a potentially more affordable solution, in a one-stop shop with national, if not global scope.

# Style guide
 
As a company that deals in tools and construction it is important to convey strength, stability and reliability to our users. A Sans serif font would best fit this ideal as they are a bold no-nonsense design providing a sense of substance and strength.
To this end Neue Helvetica eText was identified as the optimal candidate. 
In the 80's Helvetica was updated to Helvetica Neue to make the font more current.  
More recently, Neue Helvetica etext was developed which is, 

*"specifically tailored for the text-heavy environments of e-readers, tablets, mobile devices, and the web. Neue Helvetica eText consists of four weights with corresponding italics, all designed and optimized to enhance the reading experience at the smaller point sizes that contemporary web and device environments call for."*
