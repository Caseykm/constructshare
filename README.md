## Problem

There is a unfulfilled need for an online peer to peer construction equipment leasing website. There are many sites of individual leasing companies, but none are peer to peer.  
This leaves equipment owners limited options to advertise their equipment for lease.  
It also leaves lessors with higher rental rates than what one would expect from peer to peer leasing.  

Another problem with existing sites is that they are often local leasing companies. Borrowers need to find conveniently located equipment, however if they find an individual leasing company, they are not guaranteed to have found the most convenient location.  

The construction lending market is expanding significantly.  This increases the demand for equipment. It also increases the potential supply of inventory available for lease, in the form of left-over equipment from completed projects.  

## Solution

Create a peer to peer, construction leasing/lending website that shows the availability of equipment available on a map for lease within an area.  
For lessees, this solution will untap latent inventory,  enabling increased return on assets.  For lessors, it will provide increased equipment choice, locational convenience and a potentially more affordable solution, in a one-stop shop with national scope.

# Style guide
 
As a company that deals in tools and construction it is important to convey strength, stability and reliability to our users. A Sans serif font would best fit this ideal as they are a bold no-nonsense design providing a sense of substance and strength.
To this end Neue Helvetica eText was identified as the optimal candidate. 
In the 80's Helvetica was updated to Helvetica Neue to make the font more current.  
More recently, Neue Helvetica etext was developed which is, 

*"specifically tailored for the text-heavy environments of e-readers, tablets, mobile devices, and the web. Neue Helvetica eText consists of four weights with corresponding italics, all designed and optimized to enhance the reading experience at the smaller point sizes that contemporary web and device environments call for."*
